throw : it is used to throw an error.
	throw new Exceptionclassname("message");

throws : it is used with methods which can throw an exception and this exception is not handled inside the method. so we can say when we have an unhandled exception in a method then we have to include throws keyword along with exception class name to inform the caller method about the exception so that it can handle this exception.

public void add()throws NullPointerException
{
}
Custom Exception :  
it is user defined exception class. if you want to define an exception class of your own, then we can also create an exception child class in our project.
it is possible by  the help of inheritance. 
we need to create a new child class of the exception class in order to create a custom exception.
Syntax:-
class MyException extends Exception
{
	public MyException(String msg)
	{
		super(msg);

		other instruction/call methods
	}
}
